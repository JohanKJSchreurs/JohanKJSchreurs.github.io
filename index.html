    <h1>Who am I</h1>
    I'm a software developer who is trained as a visual effects artist and my mission is make tools for CG artists that let you focus on the artwork and getting results quickly. As a fellow artist I know the pain or endlessly repeating cumbersome steps with finicky tools.
    
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Just one for now. More in development but not ready for publishing yet. I'd like to get them at least to a certain level before I put it on here.
